This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then, inspect browser developer tools, the network tab, and add page filter and fetch/xhr. 

Then keep on scrolling, and you will see subsequent page requests:
